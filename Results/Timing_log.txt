1st conv
  ydims[0]=10, ydims[1]=24, ydims[2]=24, ydims[3]=32
  xdims[0]=10, xdims[1]=28, xdims[2]=28, xdims[3]=1
  wdims[0]=5, wdims[1]=5, wdims[2]=1, wdims[3]=32
Then sampling. Then 2nd convo
  ydims[0]=10, ydims[1]=8, ydims[2]=8, ydims[3]=64
  xdims[0]=10, xdims[1]=12, xdims[2]=12, xdims[3]=32
  wdims[0]=5, wdims[1]=5, wdims[2]=32, wdims[3]=64


Dec15 - 10,000 batches took 46 seconds. Didn’t use Remap. Used Zoe’s unroll
	Remap_coalesced takes 140us for 1st convo and 55us for 2nd convo
	Remap_non_coalesced takes 16us for 1st convo and 82us for 2nd convo
